In Binéfar (Huesca), what would be the largest slaughterhouse in Europe is about to come into operation.

€ 15,000,000 of our taxes invested to carry out the murder of 30,000 pigs per day. 30,000 daily lives, violently ended by the insatiable thirst for benefits of an industry based on the consumption of mutilated bodies.

A consumption that is:

- CRUEL, given the overwhelming evidence that these are beings so capable of feeling pain, fear and sadness, or expressing joy and affection, such as those we call "pets" and consider members of our families;

- UNNECESSARY, knowing the position of the most important associations of nutrition and dietetics in the world that meat does not provide any nutrient not available in other foods of plant origin;

- UNHEALTHY, as evidenced by the increasingly numerous studies that directly associate it with coronary heart disease, hypertension, mole 2 diabetes or various types of cancers;

- UNSUSTAINABLE, due to the great environmental impact of both intensive farms and slaughterhouses themselves, due to the enormous consumption of energy and drinking water and air, soil and water pollution.

What happens to the potential job creation in the slaughterhouse?

Perhaps before we must ask ourselves what consequences it has to work in an environment of such physical and psychological burden. These are only some that have been evidenced by many studies:

- Cuts and serious physical injuries;
- Anxiety, depression, dissociation and paranoia, Posttraumatic stress disorder;
- Increase in crime rates, domestic violence, alcohol and drug abuse.

From no point of view can we justify this authentic holocaust, which not only undermines the right to life of sentient and capable beings, but also endangers our personal health, that of our communities and that of our nature.
