In Zafra (Badajoz) a project is underway to begin the works of what will be the largest slaughterhouse in Extremadura (A southern Spanish region). Once registered the project, the slaughterhouse has refined its main figures:


- The stakeholders estimate an investment of 17 million euros and a workforce that will reach a hundred employees in full operation.

- The initial forecast is to sacrifice 142,500 pigs per year. That is, 240 pigs per hour, to which we must add 120 pigs being butchered at the same time.

From the first year of operation and on more animals will be killed in a gradual manner. It would be 213,750 pigs in a second phase; 256,500 in the third and the maximum figure of 468,000 annual sacrifices would be reached, with forecast included of possible extension in the lands purchased in the municipal pasture of Zafra.
As announced by the president, it is expected that construction work will begin before the end of this year, on 50 hectares of land, and that it will be operational in 2021.
It is promoted by the Iberian Complex of Extremadura (CIBEX), which brings together seven companies: Señorío de Montanera, Cooperativa Ibercom, Estirpe Negra, Industrias Cárnicas Villar, Montesano, Grupo Alejandro Miguel and Campofrío.


FROM THE ZAFRA STOP MACROMATADERO PLATFORM WE ARE OPPOSING TO:


- Allow € 17,000,000 of our taxes to be invested to carry out the murder of more than 5,000 piglets per day in the first phase. So many lives, violently ended by the insatiable thirst for benefits of an industry based on the consumption of beings who love and had the right to live.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE JOBS THAT THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE WILL CREATE?


Perhaps before we must ask ourselves what consequences it has to work in an environment of such physical and psychological burden. These are only some symptoms that have been proven by many studies:

- Cuts and serious physical injuries;
- Anxiety, depression, dissociation, paranoia and PTSD;
- Increase in crime rates, domestic abuse, alcohol and drug abuse.

We can’t justify this authentic holocaust, which not only undermines the right to life of sentient and capable beings, but also endangers our personal health, that of our communities and that of our nature.

ANIMALS AND THE PLANET NEED US, WE NEED TO JOIN OUR VOICES!
